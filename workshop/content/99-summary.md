title: Summary

You explored a small but realistic layout for a Datalab workspace:

- **content/** holds the instructional Markdown pages.
- **data/** holds inputs used by the steps.

You practiced listing files, verifying them, running a small Python check without extra packages, and transferring data with the AWS CLI (or rclone). This pattern scales well: keep instructions close to the code and data, use relative paths, and keep the environment assumptions minimal.
